## Brain Tumor Segmentation in Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Using 3D BUNet model

There are two phases to this project: first, a diagnosis of brain tumors by segmenting structural mr images (T1, T1Gd, T2, T2-FLAIR) into three parts (ET, ED, NCR/NET), and second, a prognosis.
The datasets were provided by University of Pennsylvania as part of the [BraTS challenge 2020](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2020/data.html).
